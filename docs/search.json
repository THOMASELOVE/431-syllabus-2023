What separates “doing data science” from “doing data analysis” is programming.\n\nThis is NOT a course in mathematical statistics or statistical inference. It’s far more applied than that."

Not much.\nUseful prior experience includes training/experience in statistics, coding/programming and biology/biomedical science. We expect most people will have some experience in one or two of these areas, but very few will have all three.\n\nSome students have lots of prior training in statistics. But there are many students in the class with no statistical training at all that they use regularly. We assume only that everyone knows what an average is, and has some sense of why statistics might be useful to them in their chosen field.\n\nSome students have lots of prior coding and programming experience, including experience with R. Some have never written a line of code in their life. We assume only that everyone is willing to learn how to do modern work with data, and that means writing computer code, but that some people will be starting from nothing.\nSome students have lots of prior experience with biological and biomedical science, and know a lot of useful things in those areas which relate directly to our work. Others have zero experience in this area, and will learn a lot from their colleagues. We assume only that everyone is willing to learn, and to put in some effort to do so.\n\nPeople succeed in this course with a wide range of backgrounds and a common interest in using data effectively in research related to biology, health or medicine. There will be multiple people in the class who are years away from their last statistics class. We expect the majority of students will have no prior experience using R, or any meaningful recollection of using statistical software.\nThe pace can be brisk at times, but all CWRU students who feel up to it are welcome, regardless of their field of study or prior experience. Section 1 (Professor Love’s section) is specifically geared towards students in programs under the auspices of the Department of Population & Quantitative Health Sciences, as well as students who intend to continue on and take 432 this Spring. Section 2 (with Professor Zhang) is more appropriate for most other students."

Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard. R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\nR is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. Information about getting R and RStudio on your computer will be found below in the Getting the Software section of this Syllabus, and this material is also available on the main course web site.\nLearning R can be difficult at first - it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham-the chief scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to the teaching assistants, talk to classmates, ask questions, e-mail Professor Love, etc.\nI promise you can do this.\nSome of this material is also borrowed from Andrew Heiss, especially here and here."

    "text": "6.2 Getting the Software\nEverything is free, but it does require some patience to get control over your computer.\n\n6.2.1 System Requirements\nYou will need access to a computer to do your work for this class, not just an iPad or other tablet, but an actual computer. Whether or not you want to bring that computer to class is up to you. All of the software we will use in this class is either free and open source, or available to you for free through your affiliation with CWRU, so there is nothing to buy in terms of software.\n\nWe’ve made some effort in terms of course requirements to set the bar low. You do not need a state of the art machine, nor should you need any special hardware to run things for this course.\nYou will need a computer, either PC (running Windows 10 or 11, ideally) or Macintosh (running a reasonably recent OS), but your choice should be determined by your personal preferences and how you believe you will use the machine in your research life. RStudio and R will look and work the same on either a PC or a Macintosh.\nWe do not recommend the use of a Chromebook for 431 or 432.\nR and RStudio Desktop also run on Linux systems but Professor Love knows essentially nothing about that. Consult the documentation at CRAN for R and at the download page for RStudio.\n\n\n\n6.2.2 What will I need for 431?\nThese instructions are also available on the Software page at our main course website: https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/.\n\nDownload and install the latest version of R (version 4.2.1 or later) from http://cran.case.edu/ or, if you prefer, from https://cloud.r-project.org which automatically chooses a fast, nearby mirror for you.\n\nIf you have a pre-existing installation of R and/or RStudio, we highly recommend that you re-install both to get current.\n\nDownload and install RStudio Desktop (Open Source Edition - the free version 2022.07.1+554 or later) at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download.\n\nIf you prefer, you can instead install RStudio’s Preview Version to get the very latest features, but that requires you to update your setup more frequently, and occasionally deal with some additional troubleshooting.\nProfessor Love will stick with the regular open source version in his work for 431.\n\nInstall some R packages - an R “package” is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that extends the capabilities of R, and is the critical way to get R doing interesting work.\n\nDetails on installing key packages we will use in 431 are found at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-packages, and that’s also where you’ll find a list of packages you’ll need in the 431 course.\n\nDownload data and code (functions) we’ve developed specifically for 431 at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data.\n\nFollow the instructions you’ll find there.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Need Installation Help?\nIf you need more help, you might look at this terrific resource for Installing R and RStudio from Jenny Bryan and the STAT 545 project. These are the people responsible for the great Happy Git with R project, which will also be worth your time when we are using Git and GitHub.\n\nIf you’re having trouble with installation before our first class, don’t worry too much. The TAs and Professor Love will be available to help once the class gets going.\nOnce the class starts, if you’re having installation problems or problems getting started in R, please consider visiting TA office hours or perhaps asking a question on Campuswire. We want to hear from you!"

    "text": "6.3 Why do we teach R in 431-432?\nWhy do we teach using R, rather than SAS or SPSS or Python or whatever?\n\nBecause it is by far the better choice for what we’re trying to do, which is to help you become effective data scientists. And effective scientists, period.\nBecause being a data scientist means writing code and actually doing (not just talking about) replicable research, which R facilitates in an immense variety of ways.\nBecause R is free to you, me and everyone, and its community is a daily delight.\n\nTo read comments from other people on the subject, I suggest reading Why R? from Chester Ismay and Patrick Kennedy.\nAlso, the question of “Why R and not SPSS?” was nicely addressed by Greg Snow in this 2010 post at StackOverflow…\n\nWhen talking about user friendliness of computer software I like the analogy of cars vs. busses: Busses are very easy to use, you just need to know which bus to get on, where to get on, and where to get off (and you need to pay your fare). Cars on the other hand require much more work, you need to have some type of map or directions (even if the map is in your head), you need to put gas in every now and then, you need to know the rules of the road (have some type of drivers licence). The big advantage of the car is that it can take you a bunch of places that the bus does not go and it is quicker for some trips that would require transfering between busses. Using this analogy programs like SPSS are busses, easy to use for the standard things, but very frustrating if you want to do something that is not already preprogrammed. R is a 4-wheel drive SUV (though environmentally friendly) with a bike on the back, a kayak on top, good walking and running shoes in the passenger seat, and mountain climbing and spelunking gear in the back. R can take you anywhere you want to go if you take time to learn how to use the equipment, but that is going to take longer than learning where the bus stops are in SPSS."

Students in this class are not in competition with each other for grades. I have no set percentage of students who will receive any particular grade. We aim for substantial and timely feedback from the teaching assistants and myself on all elements of the course.\nThe course grade is based on four key areas of demonstrated accomplishment.\nCourse grades are based primarily on performance on labs, projects and quizzes. Your grade on each of these three elements will be determined separately. Then we will combine these elements as follows:\n\n\n\nElement\nWeight 1\nWeight 2\nWeight 3\nWeight 4\n\n\n\n\nLabs\n35%\n30%\n25%\n-\n\n\nProjects\n45%\n40%\n35%\n-\n\n\nQuizzes\n25%\n20%\n15%\n-\n\n\nParticipation\n-\n-\n-\n10%\n\n\n\nAmong Labs, Projects and Quizzes, your element with the strongest score will receive Weight 1, your element with the second strongest score will receive Weight 2 and your element with the weakest score will receive weight 3. The Class Participation score (which includes the Minute Papers) is worth 10% for all students.\nProfessor Love will then determine your final course grade using the following scale:\n\ncourse averages of 88.0% to 100% will receive a A\ncourse averages of 85.0% to 87.9% will be reviewed more closely to determine whether the grade will be A or B\ncourse averages of 70.0% to 84.9% will receive a B\n\nFor students in the 85.0-87.9% range, students who have improved from the first half of the course to the second will be more likely to receive an A than those whose performance has declined.\nStudents whose course average is near or below 70% usually have failed to complete some element of the course, and need to take an Incomplete to complete their work before I assign a final grade.

To that end, students are requested not to dispute any grading on Labs during the semester, but instead to request a review using the Google Form for Lab Appeals that can be found linked on the Assignments page on our main web site.\nShould you receive a lower grade on a Lab than you feel you deserve based on the feedback the TA provides, the answer sketch and the grading rubric, you can submit a request for a regrade by Professor Love by submitting a request through a Google Form he will provide to you.\n\nOn the course’s Labs page, we include a section about Lab Regrade Requests. There, you’ll find a link to this Google Form (you must log into Google via CWRU to see it) listing all of the Labs. Any student who wishes to dispute points can specify the number of points in question for each item, and the details of the issues that concern them.\n\nAll forms must be submitted by the deadline in December specified on the Course Calendar.\nIf you wish to dispute a grade, just fill out the form at any time before the deadline in December. You can edit the form after submitting it so that you can add additional requests up until the end of the semester.\nDisputing a grade on a homework with a teaching assistant is pointless.\nProfessor Love is responsible for all final grading decisions, and if you have a concern, you should submit your request through the form.\n\n\nStudents are welcome to ask questions of Professor Love about grading during the term. The TAs and Professor Love are happy to discuss in a general sense any questions about an assignment, but no grades will be changed until the end of the term. - The one exception is if there is a mistake in adding up points, or some similar clerical error. If you find such an issue, please bring it to Professor Love’s attention via email, and such problems will be corrected immediately.\nIn mid-December, after Professor Love has worked out what letter grade to give each student, he will go through the requests on the form and determine for each whether the student’s letter grade would change if all of the points in dispute were granted. If the answer is no, then he won’t even look at the disputed grade(s). If the answer is yes, then he will look very carefully to see if enough extra points are merited to change a grade. (It will not help your case to submit frivolous requests.)\nThe main advantage of this system is that it saves all of us the hassle of haggling over points that are never going to mean anything anyway. It also provides “equal access” to students who are too timid to express their concerns. Finally, if there is an issue with grading a particular problem or assignment that needs to be reconsidered, Professor Love will have access to all papers and can make a universal decision1."

It is the student’s responsibility to notify the instructor of the circumstances preventing completion.\n\n\n\n\nThe student has been passing the course and only a small segment of the course remains to be completed, such as a term paper, for which the extenuating circumstances justify a special exception.\n\n\n\nAn Incomplete grade may not be assigned if a student is absent from a final examination, unless the dean has authorized the absence. Unauthorized absence from a final examination will result in a failing grade. When the student completes the work, the Incomplete is changed to an A, B, C, D, P, F, or NP.\n\n\nAll work for the incomplete grade must be made up and the change of grade recorded in the Office of the University Registrar by the date specified by the instructor, but no later than the last day of class in the semester following the one in which the Incomplete was received. A student who has a permanent Incomplete for a required course must retake the course in a later term. If the student cannot complete the work by the end of the following semester, he or she must petition for an extension which must be endorsed by the instructor, explain the reasons why the work has not been completed, and include a new date for completion. Students will be allowed only one extension of no more than one additional semester to complete the work for an Incomplete grade."

Please turn off or silence all cell/smart phones, tablets, and other electronic devices for the duration of the course. Inappropriate uses will be noted and may affect the final grade.”\n\nProfessor Love adds that, in this class, the use of a laptop or other device is welcomed, and even encouraged, for taking notes on our slides, or following along with the presentation, or trying out ideas in R, but it is inappropriate for you to use such a machine for activities unrelated to the class during our time together. Silence your phone during class. The temptation to look at your phone or Facebook or email during class is nearly irresistible. Resist anyway, if only to avoid distracting your instructor and your fellow students.\nThank you."

All forms of academic dishonesty including cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation, and obstruction are violations of academic integrity standards and will result in a minimum penalty of receiving a zero for the assignment, the potential for failing the entire course. Cheating includes copying from another’s work, falsifying problem solutions or laboratory reports, or using unauthorized sources, notes or computer programs. Plagiarism includes the presentation, without proper attribution, of another’s words or ideas from printed or electronic sources. It is also plagiarism to submit, without the instructor’s consent, an assignment in one class previously submitted in another. Misrepresentation includes forgery of official academic documents, the presentation of altered or falsified documents or testimony to a university office or official, taking an exam for another student, or lying about personal circumstances to postpone tests or assignments. Obstruction occurs when a student engages in unreasonable conduct that interferes with another’s ability to conduct scholarly activity. Destroying a student’s computer file, stealing a student’s notebook, and stealing a book on reserve in the library are examples of obstruction. In addition, the incident will be reported to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and Academic Review Board for undergraduates or Senior Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, for Graduate Students.\n\nThe CWRU Statement of Ethics for graduate students can be found here: http://case.edu/gradstudies/about-the-school/policies-procedures/"

Is it easy to recall the main points? The answer, yes or no, depends not so much on the quality of the data, the effort, and the thinking that went into the report, nor on your own dutiful diligence in reading the report, but rather, and mainly, on whether the people who wrote the report had learned and practiced the skills of how to use words and pictures, first, to claim attention, and second, to claim retention: to deliver a message that sticks in the mind."

    "section": "15.4 A Few Tips from Professor Love",
    "text": "15.4 A Few Tips from Professor Love\n\nStatistics is a “getting the details right” business - we care deeply about details, and this applies to writing code or complete English sentences. RStudio has a spell-checker. To use it, click F7.\nNothing impresses us as much as a clear and concise argument, presented using well-written English sentences, effective and well-labeled figures and tables.\nDon’t parrot back material that Professor Love wrote or said. State ideas in your own words. Stating them in my words is, technically, plagiarism.\nEdit your more adventurous output; don’t present everything you know how to do in R, and don’t forget that someone is trying to read both your code and your results.\nMake your work easy to evaluate. In responding to an assignment, be sure to answer the question that was asked, restating it as necessary.\nClearly label everything: graphs, tables, your answer to a specific question. Everything. Again, make your work easy to evaluate.\nSimplify. Emphasize ideas in plain language. Avoid jargon. Use English well.\nData are plural. Use “the data are …” rather than “the data is …”\nA paragraph must contain more than one sentence.\n\nDon’t switch tenses. If you want to write in the present tense, stick to it throughout.\nDon’t write or say random sample unless you used a random number generator. If you used haphazard sampling or convenience sampling, call it what it is, and indicate whether any problems could have cropped up as a result.\nSimilarly, don’t defend a method of data collection because it is random. Most of the time we want to represent some population, and a random sample is just one way to ensure that certain types of biases have a low probability of creeping in.\nIf you want to write that you used \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) as your significance level, then state that your results were obtained using a 95% confidence level, not a 95% confidence interval, unless you are actually interpreting a confidence interval.\n\nIf you find yourself in the appalling situation of writing about a p-value, then you should state something like:\n\n[1] We’re using a 95% confidence level.\n[2] We’re using a 5% significance level.\n\n[3] We’re using \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\).\n\nDon’t use more than one of these expressions.\n\nAgain, don’t use p-values in most settings, but if you must, refer to all p-values that are less than 0.001 or perhaps less than 0.0001 as \\(p &lt; 0.001\\), rather than, for instance, \\(p = 0.00000001\\) or, worse yet, \\(p = 0\\). In a similar vein, write all \\(p\\)-values that exceed 0.99 as \\(p &gt; 0.99\\) instead of, for instance, \\(p = 1\\).\nTo the extent possible, don’t use computer-ese to label variables, plots or tables. R and Markdown allow you to change the labels on graphs and tables to meaningful things – do so. Use meaningful abbreviations, as necessary, explaining what they mean on the first usage.\nWhen in doubt, err on the side of clarity. Clear thinking leads to clear writing."
